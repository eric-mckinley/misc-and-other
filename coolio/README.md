# Gangsta Birthday

```text
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin', I don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
```

Proof [Coolio's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolio) worries about making it to *24* were unfounded.
